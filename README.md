# drchrono-immunization
This project was made to learn the basics of Django!

It uses a patients' name and birthdate to create a immunization schedule where the doctor can store the vaccine administered date and thus maintain the records for the patients. Also new immunizations can be added from the django admin.
The model has two tables each for an immunization and a patient and also their many-to-many relationship is maintained through schedule object which maintains the date each patient receives a particular vaccine.

The front end uses basic HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for display purposes.
